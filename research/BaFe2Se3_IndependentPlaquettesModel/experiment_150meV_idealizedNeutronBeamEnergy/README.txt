neutron source:  idealized beam 
- all neutrons had incident energy 150.0 meV
- zero beam divergence
- point cross section beam
- 1e7 neutrons (don't believe more than 1e6 were necessary since the beam is ideal)

sample:
- powder
- cylinder 4.5mm radius, 20mm height
- weights: absorption=0, scattering=1, transmission=0.1

scattering kernel (dispersion curves):
E = 0 meV, S(Q) = 1
E = 88 meV, S(Q) = 1
E = 108 meV, S(Q) = 1
E = 196 meV, S(Q) = 1

scattering simulation:
- 1e6 neutrons
- no multiple scattering
